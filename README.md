# magento_test_task3

A client wants to change the color of their buttons on a daily basis to attract more customers
and to find the perfect one for their store. They do not want to create a ticket on a daily basis, so their IT technicians should be able to change everything without any Magento knowledge.
You need to create a Magento console command, which will have HEX color and a Store View
IDs as parameters. And change the color of all buttons on that Store view into the color
provided.
Example of usage
./bin/magneto scandiweb:color-change 000000 1

After running this command in DEV mode all the buttons on the store view with id 1 should be
black.
It is also a good idea to check if the clientâ€™s IT guys will not type a non-existing store or wrong format color.
You can use any Magento 2 installation that you have as long as there are multiple stores set
up on it.

Module Installation

### 1. Using Zip File

* Download the Extension Zip File
* Extract & upload the files to /path/to/magento2/app/code/Baracat/Task2/

After installation by either means, enable the extension by running following commands (from root of Magento2 installation):

Then you should run Magento's setup upgrade:
```
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```
Lastly clear Magento generated suff and caches:
```
rm -rf pub/static/frontend/
rm -rf var/view_preprocessed/css/frontend/
php bin/magento cache:clean
```
